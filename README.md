# Lambda calculus sandbox
This repository contains source code for the lambda-calculus sandbox. This allows reducing terms to their normal form with or without intermediate step. Intended usage was to allow working with bigger expressions. It likely would recieve update soon to perform optimal evaluation algorithm, but is quite fast even with current implementation.
