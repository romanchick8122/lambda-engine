    <h1 id="about">About</h1>
    <p>This is a tool to work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculs</a>.
    It was meant to be used mostly for academic purposes, reducing terms to their normal form, thus, being
    interpreter in some sense</p>
    <h1 id="syntax">Syntax</h1>
    <p>The syntax we are using extends the default lambda calculus syntax to make expressions shorter removing
        redundant symbols. Despite the changes any correct lambda term is also correct under our conditions.
        <code>λ</code> is the symbol for abstraction.</p>
    <h2 id="agreements">Agreements</h2>
    <p>To simplify expressins we agree on when brackets can be skipped. The rules are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are terms, and <code>x</code> is a variable,
            then <code>λx.AB</code> is a term in this engine, and is equivalent to <code>(λx.(AB))</code> lambda
            term</li>
        <li>If <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are terms, then <code>ABC</code> is a term in this
            engine, and is equivalent to <code>(AB)C</code> lambda term</li>
        <li>If <code>λx.(λy.A)</code> is a lambda term, then <code>λxy.A</code> is a term in this engine equivalent to
            it</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>The term for church numerals addition would look like <code>λm.(λn.(λf.(λx.((mf)((nf)x)))))</code>, and can be
        expressed with <code>λmnfx.mf(nfx)</code> in this engine, thus being significantly shorter and easier to type
        and interpret by human.</p>
    <h2 id="subterms">Sub-terms</h2>
    <p>There is also a specific syntax to define sub-terms to be used in later expressions. If a line starts with
        <code>!</code> symbol it is assumed a sub-term definition line.</p>
    <p>Definition goes as follows:
        <code>!name=term</code> where name is any character sequence not containing <code>=</code> symbol and term is
        any correct term. In the following lines <code>"name"</code> would be replaced by <code>term</code>. Enough
        alpha-conversions would be applied to make no variables conflict after substitution, thus any non-bound
        variables would stau non-bound after substitution</p>
    <p>For several reasons another syntax would be used. If term used for sub-term definition has beta-normal form,
        one might use <code>!!</code> in the beginning of the line, instead of <code>!</code>. This would make engine
        define normal form of the <code>term</code> ti this name, instead of the <code>term</code> itself. This
        should not be used carelessly, because normal form computation of sub-terms is not limited by anything, and
        would get stuck in infinite loop if term doesn't have normal form.</p>
    <h1 id="execution">Execution</h1>
    <p>Whenever a computation needs to be performed via user requirement, the following happens:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Every line in the input box, except the last one and the ones that starts with <code>!</code> are
            ignored</li>
        <li>If the last line in the box is not a term, evaluation is aborted</li>
        <li>For each line that starts with <code>!</code> symbol, starting from top to the bottom
            <ol>
                <li>Expression after the <code>=</code> symbol is parsed.</li>
                <li>If expression is not a term, evaluation is aborted</li>
                <li>If line starts with <code>!!</code> term is reduced to its normal form</li>
                <li>The result is added to named mappings</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>User-requested evaluation is performed on term represented by the last line in the input box</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that substitutions are done only when necessary. Sub-term with the given name being undefined is not an
        error and would only cause term to be not substituted when it is required. Also not that any amount of
        unnecessary alpha-conversions can be applied in any evaluation</p>
    <h1 id="inputs">Inputs</h1>
    <h2 id="maininputbox">Main input box</h2>
    <p>Main input box is the box at the top of the screen, occupying most of it. It is used to input all terms and
        sub-terms. For simplicity, you can use <code>Alt+L</code> to type in <code>λ</code> symbol.</p>
    <h2 id="executionlimit">Execution limit</h2>
    <p>The value in this box is the number of atomic operations that can be performed by user-requested evaluation
        before it is aborted. Value of <code>-1</code> means unlimited evaluation</p>
    <h2 id="normalform">Normal form</h2>
    <p>This section is about user-requested evaluations that lead to normal form of the term</p>
    <h3 id="doonebetareduction">Do one beta reduction</h3>
    <p>This button reduces the term with only one normal-order beta-reduction, thus guaranteeing that if term has
        normal form and button is clicked enough times the normal form would eventually be reached. The resulting term
        would be appended to the main input box. If the term is already in normal form, the resulting term would be the
        same as input</p>
    <h3 id="getnormalform">Get normal form</h3>
    <p>This button requests reducing the term to its beta-normal form. Terms normal form is appended to the main input
        box</p>
    <h3 id="intermediatesteps">Intermediate steps</h3>
    <p>If this checkbox is checked, when term is reduced to normal form, the intermediate result would be appended to
        the main input box after every beta-reduction applied. Checking this significantly reduces performance</p>
    <h2 id="namedoutput">Named output</h2>
    <p>Whenever this checkbox is checked, sub-terms would be replaced with their names whenever an output is appended to
        the main input box. Only the terms that are exactly the same, or that can be converted to the sub-term with
        only alpha conversions and adding and removing unnecessary brackets, defined by agreements, would be replaced
        with the name</p>
